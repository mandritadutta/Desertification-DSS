# Desertification-DSS
Desertification is the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas primarily caused by human activities and climate variations. It is a process where fertile land turns into a desert because of the irrational use of natural resources in vulnerable lands. These areas are affected by successive droughts and climate fluctuations.
